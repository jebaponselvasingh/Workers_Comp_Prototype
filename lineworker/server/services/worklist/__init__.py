"""`services/worklist` — the caseload's read aggregates and, from Epic 3,
its action-checklist writes.

Story 1.4 gives it read aggregates only: this story touches no claim
entity, so there are no AD-4 commands and no AD-12 ownership here yet. Its
job is to compose two things it does not own — the scoped repository
(AD-7) and the derivations registry (AD-10) — into the numbers a screen
renders (AD-1: a figure on screen came from a service).
